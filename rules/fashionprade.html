                <p>Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street; fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening. Come and participate to glisten the stage with your latest trends, show off your designs and fill the atmosphere with your attitude!

Contestants should note that it is not a fashion designing competition but a fashion show. Hence the emphasis in this competition is not on the clothes you design but on how you carry yourselves in those clothes and depict a story or a theme through your attires, walks and choreography.
